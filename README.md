# Kubernetes-Reloader
Kubernetes Reloader is a tool used to automatically reload Kubernetes resources, such as Pods and Deployments, when a referenced ConfigMap or Secret is updated. This is particularly useful in scenarios where applications need to be reloaded to pick up new configurations without requiring manual intervention or restarting the Pods manually.
